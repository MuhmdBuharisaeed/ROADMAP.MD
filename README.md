## ROADMAP (Phases-Based)

### **Introduction**
ALBUKHR Investment Limited does not tie its roadmap to specific years, because two major realities affect our journey:  
1. Lack of sufficient funds at the moment to build all desired infrastructures.  
2. Dependence on Pi Network’s open mainnet and access to Pi tokens staked by pioneers, which is one of the core pillars of our ecosystem.  

Therefore, our roadmap is structured into **phases** rather than years. This reflects flexibility and long-term vision based on resources, funding, and community strength.
